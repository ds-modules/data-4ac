    "Decision making within the United States criminal justice system relies heavily on risk assessment, which determines the potential risk that a released defendant will fail to appear in court or cause harm to the public. Judges use these assessments to decide if bail can be set or if a defendant should be detained before trial. While this is not new in the legal system, the use of risk scores determined by an algorithm are gaining prevalence and support. Proponents promote the use of risk scores to guide judges in their decision making, arguing that machine learning could lead to greater efficiency, accountability, and less biased decisions compared with human judgment ([Henry](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained/)). On the other hand, critical voices raise the concern that biases can creep into these algorithms at any point in the process, and that algorithms are often applied to the wrong situations ([Henry](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained/)). Further, they exacerbate the racism embedded deep within the criminal justice system by perpetuating inequalities found in historical data ([Henry](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the debate about the use of risk assessment algorithms, people have used data analysis to determine the extent to which these algorithms are fair to different groups of people. In this notebook, **you will explore some of the many definitions and metrics (different ways of operationalizing data to quantify those definitions) of fairness that you will apply to a prominent  risk assessment tool called COMPAS in an attempt to evaluate whether the algorithm is biased**.  Along the way, you will examine the arguments and analyses made by the company that created COMPAS and the critics of this risk assessment tool to gain a deeper understanding of the technical and societal interpretations and implications of fairness. \n"

    "**NOTE**: When we discuss bias in this notebook, we define it most generally as prejudice or an inclination in favor of one person, thing, or group compared to another. In the context of machine learning, bias is a “phenomenon that occurs when an algorithm produces results that are systemically prejudiced due to erroneous assumptions in the machine learning process” ([Rouse](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning-bias-algorithm-bias-or-AI-bias#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20bias%2C%20also%20sometimes,in%20the%20machine%20learning%20process))."

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Identify how algorithms exist as part of socio-technical systems - as in, they are technological tools that are created by and interact with humans in social institutions.\n",
    "- Recognize that there are different definitions of fairness that can be applied to evaluate algorithms, and critically examine how these definitions are emerging from and support different sociotechnical imaginaries of justice. \n",
    "- Understand how definitions of fairness are co-produced with racist systems/institutions. \n",
    "- Recognize the limits and opportunities of technical solutions to problems of algorithmic bias, and what historical and institutional contexts need to be considered to aim for fairness in algorithm design and deployment.\n",
    "- Consider what kinds of community knowledge and other professional expertise besides their own is necessary to think through socio-technical issues.\n",
    "- Consider what issues that are relevant to the COMPAS ecosystem (i.e. criminal justice system, affected communities) but outside of the algorithm itself, need to be addressed to be able to create a more just system, with or without the algorithm.\n"

    "\n",
    "COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a commercial tool produced by the for-profit company Northpointe known as a recidivism risk assessment system. Tools like COMPAS are used **to predict the risk of future crimes for an individual who has entered the US criminal justice system by outputting a risk score from 1-10**. While COMPAS was initially intended to aid decisions made by probation officers on treatment and supervision of those who are incarcerated, Northpointe has since emphasized the scalability of the tool to “fit the needs of many different decision points'' including pre-screening assessments, pretrial release decisions (whether or not to hold an arrested individual in jail until their trial), and post-trial next steps for the defendant ([Northpointe](http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/downloads/FAQ_Document.pdf)). These algorithms are believed by many to hold the power to relieve the court system of unfair human bias from criminal justice officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: In machine learning, COMPAS is considered a ***model***. A model is composed of a dataset that has ***features*** (the columns in the data table) and an ***algorithm***, which is a procedure that predicts a target feature from other features in the dataset. For example, COMPAS uses an algorithm to predict the likelihood of recidivism with a risk score (target feature) by using information about the defendant such as age and criminal history (represented in the columns of our dataset). \n"

    "\n",
    "ProPublica is a nonprofit organization that “produces investigative journalism with moral force” ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/about/)). ProPublica was founded as a nonpartisan newsroom aiming to expose and question abuses of power, justice, and public trust, often by systems and institutions deeply ingrained in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, ProPublica investigated the COMPAS algorithm to assess the accuracy of and potential racial bias within the tool, as it became more popular within the United States court system nationwide. In their analysis, ProPublica used data from defendants with risk scores from Broward County from 2013 to 2014 to test for statistical differences in outcomes for Black and white defendants, which ultimately highlighted racial disparities that exist within the algorithm. ProPublica came to the conclusion that COMPAS utilizes data from a criminal justice system with a history of racial injustices, thus continuing to disproportionately target and arrest Black people in comparison to their white counterparts. While the COMPAS algorithm treats unequal groups alike, which may appear neutral, ProPublica’s data analysis and reporting emphasized the bias against Black defendants and their communities that COMPAS produced from this line of thinking, a claim that Northpointe has disputed (as we will see later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's retrace ProPublica's statistical analysis in order to better understand ProPublica's argument and engage with the metric of fairness that it uses. In order to mimic their analysis more closely, we will use ProPublica’s definitions of “high” and “low” scores: any score above a 4 is considered a high score, while 4 and below is considered a low score. \n"

    "Northpointe (merged with two other companies to create equivant in 2017) is a for-profit computer software company that aims to advance justice by informing and instilling confidence in decision makers at every stage of the criminal justice system ([equivant](https://www.equivant.com/)).  In addition to operating and continuing to develop COMPAS, *equivant* has developed a variety of technologies for use in court case management, attorney case management, inmate classification, and risk/needs assessment strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the wake of criticism from ProPublica and other researchers alike, Northpointe produced a [detailed response](http://go.volarisgroup.com/rs/430-MBX-989/images/ProPublica_Commentary_Final_070616.pdf) to ProPublica’s allegations, claiming that these critiques of their tool utilized the wrong type of classification statistics in their analysis and portrayed the tool incorrectly. The company provided their own analysis of the COMPAS algorithm by using different statistical methods and responding individually to each of ProPublica’s claims of racial bias against Black defendants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon examining their tool’s fairness through a metric called *accuracy equity* (a metric that was left out of ProPublica’s analysis), as well as the fact that the model was not trained with a race feature, Northpointe concluded that their algorithm treats all people and specified groups equally, and therefore does not exhibit signs of bias or inequality for specified groups. Now, let’s take a look at how Northpointe supported this argument.\n"

Once again, the TPR is a new way to measure the “goodness” of a model, similar to FNR and FPR. Northpointe made use of the *ROC Curve*, which we describe below, to prove what they refer to as ***Accuracy Equity***. Accuracy equity, according to [Northpointe](http://go.volarisgroup.com/rs/430-MBX-989/images/ProPublica_Commentary_Final_070616.pdf), is exhibited in the model “if it can discriminate recidivists and nonrecidivists equally well for two different groups such as blacks and whites.” In order to connect these two ideas, we first need to learn what this curve does and how it is used to understand fairness. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, you will go through yet another metric used to evaluate fairness in machine learning: disparate impact. Disparate impact is a legal doctrine that determines if there is unintended discrimination towards a protected class ([Society for Human Resource Management](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/disparateimpactdisparatetreatment.aspx)). In machine learning, disparate impact is a metric to evaluate fairness in a model. It is a form of bias within an algorithm that reflects systemic discrimination when a model’s outputs are dependent on a ***sensitive feature*** (the protected class). This is often considered unintentional (like the legal doctrine) due to the fact that the sensitive feature is omitted from the model, though it is still correlated with the output through proxy variables ([Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05398.pdf#:~:text=Abstract%E2%80%94In%20the%20context%20of,e.g.%2C%20race%20or%20gender)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of simply evaluating the fairness of the COMPAS tool after the fact, we will notice and remove bias from the dataset to actually change the outputs of the model, and therefore demonstrate another technique aimed at creating a fair algorithm. In order to do so, we need to quantify the disparate impact in the dataset and use aif360 (a special Python package with fairness tools for machine learning) to remove the bias completely. "
