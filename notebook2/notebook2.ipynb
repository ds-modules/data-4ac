    "# Notebook 2: Japanese-American Detainment During World War II\n",
    "\n",
    "Executive Order 9066 was signed and issued by President Franklin Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. This order gave the U.S. army authorization to evacuate any individual considered a threat to national security from designated military exclusion zones along the West Coast to internment camps further inland. The passing of this executive order began the process of funneling Japanese-Americans into intermediate assembly centers and finally permanent internment centers. \n",
    "\n",
    "By working through this notebook, you will be able to visualize the forced movement of Japanese-Americans, from the West Coast of the United States, to scattered detainment camps, and eventually to cities throughout the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will learn about:\n",
    "- The displacement of Japanese-Americans before and after detainment\n",
    "- Basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis\n",
    "- Recognizing how data can restrict the types of analysis we can perform\n",
    "- Using different visualizations to discover traits about our data\n",

    "In data science, we utilize large and diverse datasets to make conclusions and predictions about the world we live in. Doing so involves a process called the data science lifecycle, which is a high-level description of the stages of work that data scientists perform as they work on a data science project. There are a number of data science lifecycles that people have developed and use to learn and practice data science. The lifecycle that we will be working with in DATA-4AC is a newly updated lifecycle that considers the human contexts and ethics of data at every stage. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/dsethoslifecycle.png\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is often iterated as new questions and problems emerge after the last step that enable data practitioners  to learn more about the characteristics and patterns of the world, which in turn informs the kinds of questions that are asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on stages 2 and 3. We'll first introduce the data sets used in this notebook and then take a deeper look into the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). We perform EDA to uncover any patterns or features from the data and better understand the underlying structure. EDA can involve looking for outliers or anomalies, identifying important variables, and data visualization. "

Thus, there may still be some human error. The datasets include the populations of each camp by month, the relocation destinations of those who were incarcerated, and the Japanese-American population in the United States before and during the war. Take a look at the full dataset [here](https://data.world/infinitecoop/japanese-internment-camps/).\n",

    "The second dataset we're working with is from the story map \"Behind Barbed Wire,\" created by the Library of Congress. The data comes from newspapers that were produced by Japanese-American detainees while they lived in the camps. Camp newspapers circulated administrative announcements, events, vital statistics, news from other camps, and other information about daily camp life. They also included [comics](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84024049/1942-11-18/ed-1/?sp=7), opinion pieces, job opportunities, and even results from baseball games. These newspapers helped maintain a sense of normalcy for their detained authors and readers, something that the WRA tables do not reflect.

A disadvantage of the first map is that the circles begin to overlap and cloud the overall view of the map. An advantage of the first map is that it is very easy to tell where large populations lie on the map. A disadvantage of the second map is that one must consult the legend to understand what the map is displaying. An advantage of the second map is that each marker is clearly visible and they do not overlap.*"
