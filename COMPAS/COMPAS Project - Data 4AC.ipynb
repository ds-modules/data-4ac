    "\n",
    "Risk assessment is an important component of the criminal justice system. In the United States, judges set bail and decide pre-trial detention based on their assessment of the potential risk that a released defendant will fail to appear at trial or cause harm to the public. While actuarial risk assessment is not new in this domain, there is increasing support for the use of learned risk scores to guide human judges in their decisions. Proponents argue that machine learning could lead to greater efficiency, accountability, and less biased decisions compared with human judgment ([Henry](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained/)). Critical voices raise the concern that biases can creep into these algorithms at any point in the process, and that algorithms are often applied to the wrong situations ([Henry](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained/)). Further, they exacerbate the racism embedded deep within the criminal justice system by perpetuating inequalities found in historical data ([Henry](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will explore some of the many definitions and metrics of fairness that can be applied to the risk assessment tool COMPAS to understand and provide evidence for or against the presence of bias within the algorithm. You will examine the arguments and analyses made by the company that created COMPAS and their critics to gain a deeper understanding of the technical and societal interpretations and implications of fairness.

    "COMPAS is a commercial tool produced by the for-profit company Northpointe known as a recidivism risk assessment system. Tools like COMPAS are used to **predict the risk of future crimes for an individual who has entered the US criminal justice system by outputting a risk score from 1-10**. While COMPAS was initially intended to aid decisions made by probation officers on treatment and supervision of those who are incarcerated, Northpointe has since emphasized the scalability of the tool to “fit the needs of many different decision points” including pre-screening assessments, pretrial release decisions (whether or not to hold an arrested individual in jail until their trial), and post-trial next steps for the defendant ([Northpointe](http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/downloads/FAQ_Document.pdf)). These algorithms are believed by many to hold the power to relieve the court system of unfair human bias from criminal justice officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: In machine learning, COMPAS is considered a ***model***. A model is composed of a dataset that has ***features*** (the columns in the data table) and an ***algorithm***, which is a procedure that predicts a target feature from other features in the dataset. For example, COMPAS uses an algorithm to predict the likelihood of recidivism with a risk score (target feature) by using information about the defendant such as age and criminal history (represented in the columns of our dataset).

    "### Who is ProPublica?\n",
    "\n",
    "ProPublica is a nonprofit organization that “produces investigative journalism with moral force\" ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/about/)). ProPublica was founded as a nonpartisan newsroom aiming to expose and question abuses of power, justice, and public trust, often by systems and institutions deeply ingrained in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, ProPublica investigated the COMPAS algorithm to assess the accuracy of and potential racial bias within the tool, as it became more popular within the United States court system nationwide. In their analysis, ProPublica used data from defendants with risk scores from Broward County from 2013 to 2014 to test for statistical differences in outcomes for Black and white defendants, which ultimately highlighted racial disparities that exist within the algorithm. ProPublica came to the conclusion that COMPAS informs its decisions on the undeniable truth that more Black people are arrested in the U.S. than their white counterparts, targeting Black folks within a system that has a long history of racial injustices. While Northpointe’s attempts to treat unequal groups alike appear neutral, ProPublica’s discoveries instead emphasized the inevitable disparate impact that is produced from this line of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a statistical analysis like ProPublica’s, you will determine if there is a significant difference in COMPAS scores between races through the use of ProPublica’s metrics of fairness. In order to mimic their analysis more closely, we will use ProPublica’s definitions of “high” and “low” scores: any score above a 4 is considered a high score, while 4 and below is considered a low score. \n"

The company provided their own analysis of the COMPAS algorithm by using different statistical methods and responding individually to ProPublica’s claims of racial bias against Black defendants. Upon examining their tool’s fairness through accuracy equity (a metric that was left out of ProPublica’s analysis) and through the fact that the model was not trained with a race feature, Northpointe concluded that their algorithm treats all citizens and specified groups equally, and therefore does not exhibit signs of bias or inequality for specified groups.

Once again, the TPR is a new way to measure the “goodness” of a model, similar to FNR and FPR.\n",

We do this by plotting the curve and deriving the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting our target variable. Northpointe utilized this method by plotting metrics we have already calculated: the FPR on the x-axis and TPR on the y-axis, and then calculating and comparing the AUC for the subgroup of data with white defendants and the subgroup of data with Black defendants."

Disparate impact is a legal doctrine that determines if there is unintended discrimination towards a protected class. Instead of evaluating the fairness of the COMPAS tool after it has been trained, we will instead notice and remove bias from the dataset before the model is created to demonstrate another technique for creating a fair algorithm. In order to do so, we need to quantify the disparate impact in the dataset and utilize aif360 (a special Python package with fairness tools for machine learning) to remove the bias completely. \n"

In technical terms, *the privileged group receives disproportionately higher scores from a trained model than the unprivileged group*, so therefore the Black defendants will be considered \"privileged\" and the white defendants will be considered \"unprivileged\" in this case. In machine learning, we can understand disparate impact as the proportion of individuals that get positive outcomes (positive outcomes, meaning if they received a high score) for the two groups described above."
