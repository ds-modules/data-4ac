By exploring these data sets we hope to obtain a clearer picture of the magnitude of prison and county jail overcrowding per facility and region, and the effects of realignment policies on state prisons and county jails.\n",

Prisons are designed for long term sentences, while jails are for those who are unsentenced or have short term sentences.

In contrast, jails are smaller and handled by a city or county.\n",
