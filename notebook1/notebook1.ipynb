    "## Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Types\n",
    "A notebook is composed of rectangular sections called **cells**. There are 2 kinds of cells: markdown and code. \n",
    "- A **markdown cell**, such as this one, contains text. \n",
    "- A **code cell** contains code. In this class, we'll be using Python, but in other data science classes you might use languages such as Julia or R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Cells\n",
    "To \"run\" a code cell (i.e. tell the computer to perform the programmed instructions in the cell), select it and either:\n",
    "- Press `Shift` + `Enter` to run the cell and move to (select) the following cell.\n",
    "- Press `Command/Control` + `Enter` to run the cell but stay on the same cell. _This can be used to re-run the same cell repeatedly._\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click the Run button in the toolbar at the top of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Results and Outputs of a Cell\n",
    "When you run a code cell, a number of things can happen, depending on the type and contents of the cell:\n",
    "1. Running a markdown cell renders the text inside of it.\n",
    "2. Running a code cell returns the result of the code below the cell.\n",
    "    - This output may be text, a number, a visualization, or nothing at all, depending on the code!\n",
    "\n",
    "If a code cell is running, you will see an asterisk (\\*) appear in the square brackets to the left of the cell. Once the cell has finished running, a number in brackets will replace the asterisk and any output from the code will appear under the cell. This number goes up by one each time you run a code cell, telling you the **order in which the code cells in your notebook have been run**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it! **Run the cell below to see the output.** Feel free to play around with the codeâ€”try changing 'World' to your name, and re-run it multiple times to see how the number to the left increments."
